It combines the privacy of your own room with the benefits of community living, all in a hassle-free, all-inclusive package. Unlike traditional renting, coliving provides instant community, premium amenities, and flexible terms."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between coliving and colocation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While both involve shared living, coliving is fundamentally different from colocation. Colocation typically means renting an apartment together and handling everything yourselves—furniture, utilities, cleaning, and finding compatible roommates. Coliving provides a turnkey solution: fully furnished spaces, all utilities included, professional cleaning, curated communities, premium amenities, and a supportive environment designed for modern living. At La Villa, we handle all the logistics so you can focus on living."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Who is coliving for?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Coliving is perfect for professionals, remote workers, digital nomads, entrepreneurs, international students, and anyone seeking a seamless living experience with genuine community connections. It's especially popular among people aged 25-40 who value experiences over possessions and want to live in vibrant, like-minded communities."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why should I choose coliving over a traditional apartment?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Coliving offers numerous advantages: no furniture shopping, no utility setup, no cleaning schedules to coordinate, instant community, access to amenities you couldn't afford alone (pools, gyms, saunas), flexible lease terms, and often significant cost savings compared to renting a studio in the same area. Plus, you gain a built-in social network and support system from day one."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is coliving expensive?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"When you factor in all costs—rent, utilities, internet, furniture, gym membership, cleaning services, and entertainment—coliving is often more economical than traditional renting. At La Villa, our all-inclusive rates start from 1,380 CHF/month, which is competitive with Geneva studio prices while including: heated pool, gym, sauna, weekly yoga classes, parking, monthly Pizza Party, meal baskets, streaming subscriptions, and more."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What makes La Villa Coliving different from other coliving spaces?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"La Villa stands out through our curated community approach, exceptional locations just 30 minutes from Geneva, premium amenities including heated pools and wellness areas, and our commitment to creating genuine connections. We're not just a place to sleep—we're a lifestyle designed for modern professionals who value both productivity and wellbeing. Our homes are designed spaces, not converted apartments, with every detail thoughtfully considered."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is the community curated at La Villa?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We carefully select each member through an application process that includes a video call and in-person meeting. We look for open-minded, respectful individuals who share our values of collaboration and community. Our goal is to create balanced, diverse communities where members can learn from each other and form meaningful connections."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the philosophy behind La Villa Coliving?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our philosophy is simple: life is better when shared. We believe that modern living should combine privacy with community, productivity with relaxation, and independence with connection. We've created spaces where you can focus on your career while building meaningful relationships, where wellness is integrated into daily life, and where coming home is something to look forward to."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between coliving and coworking?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Coworking provides shared workspace, while coliving provides shared living space. At La Villa, we combine both—you get a private bedroom and shared living areas, plus dedicated workspaces with high-speed internet. It's the perfect solution for remote workers who want to eliminate their commute and live where they work."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where did coliving come from?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Coliving emerged as a response to rising housing costs, urban isolation, and the changing nature of work. It draws inspiration from traditional communal living while incorporating modern needs for privacy, flexibility, and professional networking. The concept gained popularity in tech hubs like San Francisco and has since spread globally as a solution for modern urban living."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will I have my own private bedroom?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, absolutely. Every resident at La Villa has their own private, fully furnished bedroom with a comfortable bed, quality bedding, desk, storage, and often an en-suite bathroom. Your bedroom is your personal sanctuary—you can decorate it, work in it, and retreat to it whenever you need privacy."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What furniture is included in the bedrooms?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"All bedrooms come fully furnished with a premium bed and mattress, high-quality bedding, bedside tables, a desk with chair, wardrobe/closet, lamps, and decorative elements. Rooms are designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, providing everything you need from day one."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the bathroom arrangements?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We offer both private en-suite bathrooms and rooms with shared bathrooms, depending on the house and room type. Private bathrooms include a shower, toilet, and sink. Shared bathrooms are modern, well-maintained, and cleaned regularly. All bathrooms are stocked with basic supplies."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What common areas are available?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our common areas include fully equipped kitchens, comfortable living rooms, dining spaces, coworking areas, outdoor terraces, gardens, pools, gyms, saunas, and entertainment rooms. Each house is designed to provide both social spaces for gathering and quiet areas for relaxation or focused work."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use the kitchen?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, all residents have full access to our professional-grade kitchens. They're fully equipped with appliances, cookware, dishes, and utensils. You can cook your own meals, store food in designated areas, and many residents enjoy cooking together for community dinners."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is there storage space for my belongings?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, each bedroom includes wardrobe/closet space, and we provide additional storage options depending on the house. Some locations offer basement storage, garage space, or dedicated storage rooms.

It's truly all-inclusive."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does it cost to live at La Villa?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our rates start from 1,380 CHF per month and vary depending on the house, room type, and whether you choose a private or shared bathroom. This is an all-inclusive rate with no hidden fees. When compared to renting a studio in Geneva plus utilities and amenities, La Villa offers exceptional value."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is there a security deposit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we require a security deposit equivalent to two months' rent. This deposit is held for the duration of your stay and returned within 30 days of move-out, minus any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are there any agency fees?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, there are absolutely no agency fees at La Villa Coliving.

This helps ensure community stability and allows members to form meaningful connections. If you need to leave earlier, we require one month's notice."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the notice period if I want to leave?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We require one month's notice if you decide to leave. This allows us time to find a suitable replacement and ensure a smooth transition for the community. The notice should be provided in writing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does La Villa compare to renting in Geneva?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A studio apartment in Geneva typically costs 1,500-2,500 CHF/month, plus utilities (150-250 CHF), internet (50-80 CHF), gym membership (100-150 CHF), and you'd need to buy furniture. At La Villa, starting from 1,380 CHF, you get a furnished private room, all utilities, internet, gym, pool, sauna, cleaning, and a built-in community. The value is exceptional."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What kind of community events are organized?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We organize regular community events including monthly dinners, yoga and fitness classes, Pizza parties and seasonal celebrations and networking events.
